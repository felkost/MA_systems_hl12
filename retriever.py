"""Two-stage retrieval over the index that `ingest.py` builds.

The first stage merges a semantic arm (Chroma) with a lexical arm (BM25) and
aims at recall: documents it misses cannot be recovered later, because the
reranker only reorders what it receives. The second stage is a cross encoder
that reads query and passage together and aims at precision, cutting the
merged candidates down to `rerank_top_n`.

`langchain_classic.retrievers` and `langchain_community.cross_encoders` are
imported inside the functions that actually build a retriever, not at module
scope: `langchain_classic.retrievers` itself eagerly imports
`sentence_transformers` at its own top level, so every module that merely
needs this one's types or functions would otherwise pay for a model library
it never loaded a model with
(`test_importing_retriever_does_not_load_sentence_transformers`).

`ingest.source_hashes` is imported inside `verify_manifest` for the same
reason, one level removed: `ingest.py` imports `langchain_text_splitters`,
which -- in the versions this stage pinned -- eagerly imports
`sentence_transformers` itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    settings : Settings
        `retrieval_top_k`, `rerank_top_n` and `ensemble_bm25_weight` shape the
        funnel; `index_dir` and `collection_name` locate the index.
    embeddings : Embeddings, optional

    cross_encoder : BaseCrossEncoder, optional
